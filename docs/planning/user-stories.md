## Backlog

### High Priority
1. As a developer, I want to bootstrap a new project quickly  
   so I can start coding without setup friction.  
   AC:
   - project-init skill creates folders, git init, basic docs
   - Initial AGENTS.md and PRD.md stubs generated

2. As a developer, I want agents to load only relevant skills  
   so context stays efficient and fast.  
   AC:
   - 1–4 skills active at a time
   - No unnecessary planning docs loaded

### Medium Priority
3. As a developer, I want generated SQL/JSON saved automatically  
   so I have reference artifacts without manual saving.  
   AC:
   - Files appear in /sql/ and /examples/json/
   - Paths confirmed in response

(Add more stories as needed — keep this list short and prioritized.)
